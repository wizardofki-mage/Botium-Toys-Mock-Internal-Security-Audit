## General Info
This is a pretend internal security audit for a fictional company called Botium Toys, created as part of my Coursera/Google Cybersecurity Certification.

## Author
- Jason Ash, Computer Science Major

## Technologies
I'm currently pursuing an online Cybersecurity Certification through Coursera/Google. I created this pretend security audit in LibreOffice and saved it as a PDF so that it is more WYSIWYG for viewers. It can be viewed in any Web browser that can view PDF files or in Adobe Acrobat Reader. 

## Explaination
- Although Coursera/Google's expectation with this project was only that the yes or no controls and compliance checklists were completed, I made it into a report and added my own style, as detailed below.
- The mock audit was performed according to the instructions, and I went above and beyond with my implementation.
- I also included a recommendations section at the end of the report, which was optional in this assignment.
- I rewrote about half of the background info from the assignment prompt in the background section.
- I rewrote the current asset section with about 30% original content.
- The controls and compliance checklists were combined with prompts from the assignment description documents into one table each for controls and compliance, respectively.
- I also added a little of my own originality to the info in these tables.
- The scope, goals, risk descriptions, control best practices, and risk score were taken from the assignment instructions largely unchanged.

## Room for improvement
Since I made the assignment into a report and added a little of my own style, it's a little disjointed in its goals and scope, but not terribly so or so much that it interferes with the nature or goals of the assignment.

## Release date
24 December, 2025

## Acknowledgements
- As mentioned above, this pretend internal security audit was created as part of the Coursera/Google Cybersecurity Certification that I am pursuing. Most of the info is from the assignment prompt and description because the minimum requirement of the assignment was just to check 'yes' or 'no' based on the information they furnished you about the current situation at the fictional company Botium Toys. However, I edited some parts as explained above and made it into a more professionally presentable report.
