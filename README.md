## General Info
This is a pretend internal security audit for a fictional company called Botium Toys, created as part of my Coursera/Google Cybersecurity Certification.

## Author
- Jason Ash, Computer Science Major

## Technologies
I'm currently pursuing an online Cybersecurity Certification through Coursera/Google. I created this pretend security audit in LibreOffice and saved it as a PDF so that it is more WYSIWYG for viewers. It can be viewed in any Web browser that can view PDF files or in Adobe Acrobat Reader. 

## Explaination
- Although Coursera/Google's expectation with this project was only that the yes or no controls and compliance checklists were completed, I made it into a report and added my own style, as detailed below.
- The mock audit was performed according to the instructions, and I went above and beyond with my implementation.
- I also included a recommendations section at the end of the report, which was optional in this assignment.
- I rewrote about half of the background info from the assignment prompt in the background section.
- I rewrote the current asset section with about 30% original content.
- The controls and compliance checklists were combined with prompts from the assignment description documents into one table each for controls and compliance, respectively.
- I also added a little of my own originality to the info in these tables.
- The scope, goals, risk descriptions, control best practices, and risk score were taken from the assignment instructions largely unchanged.
